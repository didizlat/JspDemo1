For all pages: 
- Make sure that the controls look appealing and are aligned in the center of the page 
- Every page must have a control to go back to the main page
- All clickable buttons need to be clicked and do what they say they do and are functional
1. First, go to the main page. 
Description: Make sure that you see 6 tabs
- User Registration Form 
- Multi-Step Workflow Demo
- Simple Login Form
- View All Registrations
- View All Orders
- H2 Database Console
Make sure that the page says 'Welcome to JSP Demo!' 
Make sure there is no text overflow
2. Click on 'Simple Login Form'
3. Make sure the browser goes to a page called 'Login' or 'User Login'
Verify that the page contains a login form with the following fields:
- Username (text input, required)
- Password (password input, required, should show dots/asterisks for security)
- A 'Login' button
- Optionally: "Remember me" checkbox
- Optionally: "Forgot password?" link
4. Verify that the form controls are properly aligned and centered
Make sure the username field has a clear label (e.g., "Username" or "Email")
Make sure the password field has a clear label (e.g., "Password")
Make sure the form has a professional appearance
5. Verify that password field masks the input (shows dots or asterisks)
Type any text in the password field and confirm it's not visible as plain text
6. Test with INVALID credentials first:
- Username: Enter "invaliduser"
- Password: Enter "wrongpassword"
- Click on 'Login' button
7. Verify that an error message appears
The error message should indicate login failure (e.g., "Invalid username or password", "Login failed")
The error message should be clearly visible
The form should remain on the same page or show the error prominently
8. Clear the form fields or refresh the page
9. Test with VALID credentials:
- Username: Enter "admin" (or the correct test username)
- Password: Enter "password" (or the correct test password)
- Click on 'Login' button
10. Make sure the browser navigates to a success page or welcome page
Verify that the success page shows:
- A welcome message (e.g., "Welcome back!" or "Login Successful")
- The username that logged in
- Navigation options (links to home, dashboard, or other features)
- A logout option or button
- A link or button to 'Back to Home'
11. Verify that all navigation links on the welcome page are functional
Check that 'Back to Home' button works
If there's a 'Logout' button, verify it's present and clickable
12. Test logout functionality (if available):
- Click on 'Logout' button (if present)
- Verify that you are redirected back to login page or home page
- Verify that you cannot access the welcome page without logging in again
13. Verify that there is always a clear way to navigate back to the main page
